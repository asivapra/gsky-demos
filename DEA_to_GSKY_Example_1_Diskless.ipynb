    "\n",
    "Instead of writing the GSKY output into a NetCDF file and then reading it back into Xarray, this example uses the **diskless** NetCDF that eliminates the disk I/O. Though it is quite unnecessary to do so in a single datafile situation, it is nevertheless given here to demonstrate the capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is in **netCDF4.\\_netCDF4.Dataset** format. A drawback of plotting the values directly from it is that only one band per image can be plotted (cf. three bands together when using Xarray). Converting the in-memory data into Xarray Dataset does not work."

    "\n",
    "- Converting a DEA notebook example to use GSKY instead of datacube.\n",
    "- Uses WCS to get an area from a specified layer/date/bbox/time, and differs from the DEA example where an area around a single point is calculated (\"LoadingCloudfreeSentinel2andLandsat.ipynb\").\n",
    "- Identifying an area which has data is a challenge. \n",
    "    - Hence, a number of BBoxes, which are known to have data are hard coded. \n",
    "    - Selecting a date will auto select the correct BBox.\n",
    "- This example can only use one sensor (\"ls8\") instead of three sensors as DEA has used.\n",
    "- Only one time slice can be used in WCS. \n",
    "    - You can choose from all available times in the layer.\n",
    "    - Only 2 time slices have valid BBoxes hard coded. \n",
    "    - The fourth uses the whole of Australia.\n",
    "- If you can determine a valid BBox for a date (Tip: Use TerriaMap) it can be manually typed in.\n",
    "- The DEA example, using datacube, can get the data for a time range. It is not possible in GSKY.\n",
